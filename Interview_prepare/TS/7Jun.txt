Static :-->

We can Access Data members and Member Functions with out creating instance(Object)
of it.

We can directly call the data member and member functions using Class name.

Rule:-
1. The Static data members we should use at the top of varialbe declaration in the class.

2. Similar pattern the static member functions should be at the 1 declaration of functions.
After Constructor the 1 function which we need to write is Static functions.

3. Static Functions only return static variables.

Ex:-
Class TEST{
  static name=  'Ashu'
  private age = 0;
  constructor(val){
    this.age= val
  }

  public static getDefaultAge(){
    return this.age;
  }
}

// We can call it
TEST.name;

// 
TEST.getDefaultAge();

These Above 2 code give me value,
if the function is not static it will show me error.(Verified)
