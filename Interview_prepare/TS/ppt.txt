    let [, second, , fourth] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    console.log(second); // outputs 2
    console.log(fourth); // outputs 4

9. Tuple destructuring #
  let tuple: [number, string, boolean] = [7, "hello", true];
  let [a, b, c] = tuple; // a: number, b: string, c: boolean
  let [a, b, c, d] = tuple; // Error, no element at index 3
  let [a, ...bc] = tuple; // bc: [string, boolean]
  let [a, b, c, ...d] = tuple; // d: [], the empty tuple

10. Object destructuring #
  let o = {
    a: "foo",
    b: 12,
    c: "bar"
  };
  let { a, b } = o; 

11. Property renaming #
  let { a: newName1, b: newName2 } = o;
  let { a, b }: { a: string, b: number } = o;
  Note:-
    Confusingly, the colon here does not indicate the type. The type, if you specify it, 
    still needs to be written after the entire destructuring:

12. Spread Operator
  Spread #
  The spread operator is the opposite of destructuring. 
  It allows you to spread an array into another array, 
  or an object into another object. For example:

  let defaults = { food: "spicy", price: "$$", ambiance: "noisy" };
  let search = { ...defaults, food: "rich" };
  Now search is { food: "rich", price: "$$", ambiance: "noisy" }. 

  Object spreading is more complex than array spreading. Like array spreading, 
  it proceeds from left-to-right, but the result is still an object.
   This means that properties that come later in the spread object overwrite 
   properties that come earlier. So if we modify the previous example to 
   spread at the end:

  let defaults = { food: "spicy", price: "$$", ambiance: "noisy" };
  let search = { food: "rich", ...defaults };

  Then the food property in defaults overwrites food: "rich", 
  which is not what we want in this case.

Object spread also has a couple of other surprising limits. 

First, it only includes an objects’ own, enumerable properties. Basically, that means you lose methods when you spread instances of an object:

Second, the TypeScript compiler doesn’t allow spreads of type parameters from generic functions. That feature is expected in future versions of the language.

class C {
  p = 12;
  m() {
  }
}
let c = new C();
let clone = { ...c };
clone.p; // ok
clone.m(); // error!

13. read Only Interfaces

  You can construct a Point by assigning an object literal. After the assignment, x and y can’t be changed.

  let p1: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
  p1.x = 5; // error!

14. ReadOnly vs Const 

  The easiest way to remember whether to use readonly or const is to ask whether you’re using it on a variable or a property. Variables use const whereas properties use readonly.

15. Excess Property Checks

  Index Signature
    We’ll discuss index signatures in a bit, but here we’re saying a SquareConfig can have any number of properties, and as long as 
    they aren’t color or width, their types don’t matter.
